I am a Fullstack Website Developer, currently working for an Australian company. I am passionate and well-organised, with high attention to detail and dedication to getting things done. I chose this career because I have a passion for learning and helping people solve real-life problems.

&nbsp;

I like to discover new technologies related to my career. This website, for example, was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/). I am also interested in keeping up with the latest trend in other technologies, such as web3 technologies which includes the use of (but not limited to) blockchains, cryptocurrencies and nfts.

&nbsp;

Outside of work, I do some mentoring for those who needs help in coding. This includes (but not limited to) the skills mentioned in the sections below. Feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:irsanarisandy@hotmail.com) if you have any queries.
