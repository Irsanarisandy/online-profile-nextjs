excerpt: Life lessons I've learned from Esoteric BF.
---

Up until now, mankind has created all sorts of inventions that, for the most part, have improved society as a whole. Some of these past inventions, like the discovery of fire, numerical digits, and theatrical performance, have evolved into many other creations, such as [Elon's "Not-a-flamethrower"](https://www.boringcompany.com/not-a-flamethrower), tax collectors, and TikTok ASMR. But, out of all these inventions, there is one that has stood the test of time and inspired many people to, not only challenge the status quo, but to also question the purpose of their own lives. And that is [Brainf\_\_\_](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

—————

[Brainf\_\_\_](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) was invented in 1993 by Urban Müller, with the sole purpose of being simple enough to be understood by the smallest possible compiler. It consists of 8 character commands, which can be used to create real-life programs like "Hello World".

```
++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>>++++++++++++++.>+++++++++++.<<++.>>-------------.+++.<<.>>++++++++++.+++.<<.>>----.+.+++++.<<.>>.-----.<<.>>-------------.+++.
```

As you can see from this example, it shows how a computer language doesn't necessarily need to have redundant things such as variables, loops, functions and classes, and that it just requires users to be able to type like a caveman. If this elegant program is to be translated (code is in [this link](https://gist.github.com/Irsanarisandy/0132de0020bfde7d4e7fad8bd22a3a88)), it will translates to a Shakespearean quote "To be, or not to be", which is beautiful in its own way as it indicates that it simply exists and that even a pile of s\_\_\_ language is good enough to create a program. The possibilities of using this language are endless and that it could help solve many of the world's problems, such as reducing the need to worry about hacking and cyber security as it would reduce their lifespan significantly if they tried to do it.

As a philosopher, I used to ponder how this language is still relevant in today's society, especially when our lives may be meaningless and that it seems like all hope is lost. But, after much deliberation, I can conclude that no matter how meaningless its existence may be, it is up to us to give it value, like the Bored Ape NFT that literally has an average price of around $400k. Like, wtf, I could've invested in that when it started. Next time, we will discuss about how you can make some money just by selling farts in a jar.
